Introduction 
1.1 Background 
The 21st century is defined by its unprecedented access to information. News is no longer confined to the morning paper or the evening broadcast; it is a continuous, real-time stream from countless online publications, blogs, and social media channels. While this connectivity is powerful, it presents a significant challenge: information overload. Users struggle to filter through the noise to find content that is truly relevant, credible, and concise. This problem is exponentially magnified in multilingual societies like Nepal, where consumers regularly navigate between Nepali and English sources, each with its own context and nuance. 
The field of news aggregation has evolved significantly from simple RSS readers to complex AI-driven platforms. Early systems like Google News pioneered automated news collection and clustering using algorithms to group stories on the same event. However, their summarization was often rudimentary, typically extracting leading sen tences. The advent of sophisticated NLP models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT [1], and their derivatives, has revolutionized text understand ing and generation. These transformers enable abstractive summarization—paraphrasing 
and condensing text in a human-like manner—far surpassing older extractive methods. 
Simultaneously, the field of Neural Machine Translation has achieved remarkable fluency in translating between languages, making cross-lingual news consumption a tangible reality. Sentiment analysis, another key NLP task, has matured from simple keyword-based classifiers to deep learning models capable of detecting nuance, sar casm, and context-dependent emotion. Integrating this allows for the quantification of news ”mood,” a valuable feature for investors, policymakers, and general users alike. 
1
Existing news platforms and aggregators often operate in silos. Some excel at ag gregation but offer minimal curation or summarization. Others provide summaries but lack robust multilingual support, particularly for Nepali language processing. There is a conspicuous gap for a unified, intelligent system that not only aggregates news from trusted sources across languages but also understands, processes, and repackages it according to the user’s specific preferences for content volume, language, and format. 
1.2 Problem Statement 
Users in today’s fast-paced digital environment face four primary challenges in news consumption: 
• Information Overload: An excessive volume of news from numerous sources makes it difficult to identify important stories and stay informed without being overwhelmed. 
• Lack of Personalization: Most platforms offer a one-size-fits-all feed, lacking customization for content volume (brief vs. in-depth) and specific domain inter ests. 
• Language Barriers: Multilingual users, particularly Nepali and English speak ers, lack integrated platforms that can seamlessly translate and summarize content across these languages. 
• Multimedia Consumption Challenges: News is increasingly delivered via video (e.g., YouTube). Users lack tools to quickly get the summary of a long news video without watching it in its entirety. 
Therefore, the core problem is the absence of an intelligent, integrated system that can aggregate, translate, summarize, and personalize multi-format news content to pro vide an efficient, accessible, and user-defined news consumption experience. 
1.3 Objectives 
The primary purpose of the Multi-Language News Aggregation and Summarization project is to develop a fully functional web-based platform for multi-language news aggregation and intelligent summarization. The specific objectives are: 
2
• Develop a Reliable News Aggregator: Create a system that collects articles from trusted RSS feeds in Nepali and English with automated scheduling and data processing. 
• Implement Multilingual Summarization Engine: Build an NLP pipeline sup porting Nepali and English, including translation and cross-language summariza tion between these languages. 
• Provide Customizable Content Preferences: Offer user-customizable content volume preferences for summaries and personalized news feeds. 
• Enable Advanced Search and Filtering: Implement robust search and filtering capabilities by topics such as finance, sports, politics, art, culture, and interna tional news. 
• Integrate Sentiment Analysis: Provide emotional ”temperature” indicators for news content to help users understand the tone and context of stories. 
• Enhance Accessibility Features: Provide text-to-speech features and responsive design for improved accessibility across different user needs and devices. 
• Deploy Production-Ready Platform: Create and deploy a scalable, responsive web platform. 
1.4 Motivation and Significance 
The motivation for this project is rooted in the democratic ideal of making information accessible and manageable for everyone. In an era of misinformation and information clutter, a tool that promotes efficient consumption of credible news is of significant social value. For the bilingual population of Nepal and the diaspora, this platform bridges a critical gap, fostering better-informed communities by providing seamless access to news content across language barriers. 
From a technical perspective, this project is significant as it involves the integration of multiple complex AI subsystems, including summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis into a single, cohesive application. It provides invaluable hands-on experience in full-stack development, API design, database management, and deploying machine learning models in a production environment. The project demon strates practical applications of modern NLP techniques including transformer models, and multilingual processing. 
3
The system addresses real-world challenges faced by news consumers daily, par ticularly those in multilingual environments. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technolo gies to create an intelligent news consumption platform, the project contributes to the broader goal of making information more accessible, digestible, and actionable. The success of this project demonstrates a practical application of AI for social good, setting a foundation that can be expanded to include more languages, advanced personalization algorithms, and stronger content verification systems in the future.

Chapter 2 
Related Works 
The proposed project builds upon several distinct but interconnected fields of research: large-scale news aggregation, natural language processing for text summarization, mul tilingual modeling, and sentiment analysis. This chapter reviews relevant literature and existing work in these domains. 
2.1 Advancements in Automated Text Summarization 
The field of text summarization has evolved dramatically with the advent of deep learn ing. While early systems relied on extractive summarization using algorithms like Tex tRank [2], which ranks sentences based on graph-based algorithms, modern approaches leverage abstractive summarization that generates novel sentences to encapsulate the meaning of the source text. 
This breakthrough has become highly effective through the use of Transformer based models like BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)[3]. BART employs a denoising autoencoder architecture that is pre-trained on corrupted text and learns to reconstruct the original, making it exceptionally powerful for text generation tasks including summarization. The model’s encoder-decoder structure allows it to un derstand context bidirectionally while generating coherent summaries autoregressively. 
This approach has been successfully applied to the Nepali language. Recent studies have created dedicated news datasets like NepSum and demonstrated that fine-tuning multilingual models achieves state-of-the-art results for Nepali abstractive summariza tion [4]. Research has confirmed the effectiveness of transformer architectures for gen erating coherent summaries from Nepali news articles [5], providing a strong founda tion for multilingual news summarization systems. 
5
2.2 Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Processing 
A core challenge in developing multilingual news platforms is handling and translating between different languages, particularly for low-resource languages like Nepali. Mod ern end-to-end models like mBART are pre-trained on many languages and can perform text generation tasks, including summarization, across different languages without ex plicit translation steps [6]. 
The success of these models for the Nepali language is no longer theoretical. Re search on NepSum [4] specifically demonstrates that fine-tuning multilingual models like mBART is a highly effective strategy for high-quality Nepali summarization. This demonstrates a clear pathway for applying advanced multilingual concepts to create practical cross-lingual summarization tools for the underserved Nepali-English lan guage pair. 
Neural Machine Translation has also advanced significantly with the introduction of transformer-based architectures. Models like Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation system can translate between multiple language pairs with high fluency, enabling seamless cross-lingual information access. These systems use attention mech anisms to align source and target language representations, producing translations that preserve semantic meaning while adapting to target language syntax and idioms. 
2.3 Sentiment Analysis 
To provide a richer understanding of news content, sentiment analysis has become an essential component of modern news platforms. Models like BERT (Bidirectional En coder Representations from Transformers) [1] capture context far more effectively than older bag-of-words or lexicon-based methods. BERT’s pre-training on masked lan guage modeling tasks enables it to understand nuanced sentiment expressions, includ ing negation, sarcasm, and context-dependent emotions. 
Significant groundwork for sentiment analysis already exists in the Nepali context. Researchers have established performance benchmarks by applying various machine learning and deep learning models to classify the sentiment of Nepali news articles. [7] The development of specialized datasets for Nepali sentiment analysis [8] further en ables the creation of robust, context-aware models for news platforms targeting Nepali speaking audiences.

3.2 System Archictecture 
The Multi-Language News Aggregation and Summarization platform employs a mod ern, scalable client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns. The archi tecture is designed to handle high traffic, provide fast response times, and integrate multiple AI-powered services seamlessly. 
  
Figure 3.1: System Architecture Design 
9
3.2.1 Architecture Components 
The proposed system follows a layered architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Each layer is designed with clearly defined responsibilities and communicates with other layers through well-defined interfaces. 
1. Client Layer (Frontend) The client layer (frontend) is implemented using Next.js 14 with React 18 and styled using Tailwind CSS. This layer is responsible for ren dering a responsive and user-friendly interface across multiple devices. It handles user interactions, form submissions, client-side state management, and routing. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs and also incorporates Progressive Web App (PWA) features to enable limited offline ac cess and improved performance. 
2. Application Layer (Backend) The application layer (backend) is developed us ing Node.js with the Express.js framework. This layer exposes RESTful API endpoints that support create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It contains the core business logic of the system, performs data validation, and co ordinates interactions with NLP services and external APIs. Additionally, the backend manages authentication and session handling, enforces rate limiting and security measures, and logs system activities and errors for monitoring and de bugging purposes. 
3. Data Layer The data layer is primarily powered by MongoDB Atlas, a cloud based NoSQL database. It stores news articles along with their metadata, user preferences, saved articles, category information, and news source details. Gen erated summaries and sentiment analysis results are also persisted in the database. To improve system performance and reduce database load, a Redis-based caching layer is used to store frequently accessed articles, trending topics, and popular search queries. 
4. NLP Services Layer The NLP services layer provides intelligent text processing capabilities. It includes a summarization service built using Hugging Face Trans former models, where BART [3] is used for English content and mBART [6] for Nepali content. This service generates summaries in three different lengths and supports both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. The senti ment analysis service classifies news articles into positive, negative, or neutral categories and assigns sentiment magnitude scores using fine-tuned BERT-based models[1]. A language detection module automatically identifies the language of incoming content and routes it through the appropriate processing pipeline. 
10
5. External APIs The system also integrates several external APIs to extend func tionality. The Google Translate API is used for bidirectional translation between Nepali and English. Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API provides audio output for improved accessibility. 
6. Scheduled Tasks Finally, scheduled background tasks are managed using node cron. RSS feeds are fetched automatically every 30 minutes to keep news content up to date. Periodic data cleanup tasks remove outdated articles on a weekly basis, and cache refresh jobs run daily to ensure that trending topics and frequently accessed data remain current.

The news aggregation pipeline implements the following workflow: 
1. Scheduled Fetching: The system performs scheduled fetching of news articles using an automated background task that runs every 30 minutes. This scheduled process retrieves data from all configured RSS feed sources to ensure that the news content remains up to date without manual intervention. 
2. Article Processing: Once the RSS feeds are fetched, article processing is carried out in multiple steps. The system parses the RSS feed XML to extract essential metadata such as the title, publication date, source, and link. The article content is then cleaned by removing HTML tags and extracting plain text. Language de tection is performed using the LangDetect library to identify whether the content 
11
is in Nepali or English. To avoid redundancy, duplicate articles are detected using content hashing techniques. Finally, articles are categorized automatically based on their source and relevant keywords. 
3. Data Storage: After processing, the data storage phase stores the raw article content and associated metadata in a MongoDB database. Indexes are created on commonly queried fields such as publication date, category, and language to improve query performance. Each article is also assigned a unique identifier to ensure efficient retrieval and management within the system. 
  
Figure 3.2: Data Flow in News Aggregation Pipeline 
3.3.2 Multilingual Summarization Engine 
The summarization engine is the core component of the platform, responsible for gen erating concise, coherent summaries in multiple languages. Implementation Approach includes the following: 
1. Model Selection: The model selection process is designed to ensure high-quality summarization for both supported languages. For English news articles, the system uses the pre-trained facebook/bart-large-cnn model [3], which has been trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset and is well-suited for abstractive news summarization. For Nepali content, an mBART model [6] fine-tuned on the Nep Sum dataset [4] is employed to handle multilingual and low-resource language characteristics effectively. All models are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, al lowing easy access, version control, and efficient deployment. 
2. Three-Tier Summarization: The system implements a three-tier summarization mechanism to provide users with flexible summary lengths. Depending on user preference, summaries can be generated in small, medium, or large formats. Each tier uses predefined minimum and maximum token lengths to control the output size while preserving key information. This approach ensures consistency across summaries and allows users to quickly choose between concise overviews and more detailed explanations without reprocessing the original content. 
12
3. Cross-Language Summarization: For cross-language summarization, the sys tem first translates the source article into the target language using the Google Translate API. The translated text is then passed through the appropriate sum marization model to generate a summary in the desired language. Finally, post processing steps are applied to improve grammatical correctness and readability, ensuring that the generated summaries remain clear and coherent despite lan guage transformation. 
3.3.3 Sentiment Analysis Implementation 
Sentiment analysis provides users with an emotional context for news articles. Imple mentation Approach includes the following: 
1. Model Architecture: The sentiment analysis module is built using transformer based models [1] optimized for text classification. For English-language con tent, the system uses the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model, which is well suited for short and medium-length news text. For Nepali content, a sepa rate sentiment model is fine-tuned on a custom Nepali dataset [8, 7] to accurately capture language-specific expressions and contextual sentiment. 
2. Classification Process: The classification process begins by loading the appro priate sentiment model based on the detected language of the input text. The model analyzes the article and classifies its sentiment into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. Along with the sentiment label, a confidence score is generated to indicate the model’s certainty. A sentiment magnitude value is then calculated to represent the overall intensity of the sentiment, allowing more nuanced interpretation beyond simple classification. 
3. Visualization: For visualization, the sentiment results are presented in a user friendly manner within the interface. Color-coded badges are used to clearly indicate sentiment categories, with green representing positive, red representing negative, and gray representing neutral sentiment. 
3.3.4 Search and Filtering System 
Robust search functionality enables users to find relevant content quickly. Implementa tion Approach includes the following: 
13
1. Full text Search: The system supports full-text search using MongoDB text in dexes applied to article titles and content, with proper handling of Nepali Unicode characters. Search results are ranked using relevance scoring to ensure that the most pertinent articles appear first. 
2. Advanced Filtering: To enhance usability, the platform provides advanced filter ing options that allow users to refine search results based on category, language, date range, and sentiment. These filters can be combined within a single API request, enabling flexible and precise content retrieval.

The platform seamlessly incorporates multiple AI subsystems, including summa rization using BART and mBART, sentiment analysis with BERT, cross-language trans lation via the Google Translate API, and speech synthesis using Google Cloud TTS. User-centric features such as three-tier summarization, advanced search and filtering, and text-to-speech accessibility were implemented to enhance usability and engage ment. 
5.2 Future Enhancement 
Future enhancements for the platform include a personalized recommendation engine that leverages machine learning to analyze user reading patterns and preferences, sug gesting articles based on past behavior and similar user profiles, and generating cus tomized daily news digests. The system could also incorporate user accounts and pro files, enabling authentication via email or social logins, saving favorite articles, creating 
18
reading lists, tracking reading history, and synchronizing preferences across multiple devices. 
An email newsletter system could provide automated daily or weekly digests, allow ing users to customize content categories and receive summaries of top stories sched uled according to their time zones. To further extend accessibility, native mobile ap plications for iOS and Android are planned, featuring push notifications for breaking news, offline reading, and gesture-based navigation for a smooth user experience. 
Additionally, social features would allow users to share articles on social media, par ticipate in comments and discussion threads, rate sources, and contribute to community curated collections. An advanced analytics dashboard is envisioned to visualize senti ment trends over time, perform topic clustering and relationship mapping, show the geographic distribution of news events, and enable comparative analysis of coverage across different sources, offering deeper insights for both users and researchers. 
5.3 Technical Improvement 
5.3.1 Performance Optimizations 
Future improvements for the platform focus on infrastructure scaling to handle in creased user demand and ensure low-latency access globally. Horizontal scaling with load balancers and container orchestration using Kubernetes will enable dynamic re source allocation, while deployment across multiple geographic regions and integration with a content delivery network (CDN) will further reduce latency and improve relia bility. 
Database optimization is another key area, including migration to sharded Mon goDB clusters for better performance, implementation of read replicas to distribute query load, and the use of time-series collections for analytics data. Indexes will be carefully optimized based on query patterns to ensure efficient data retrieval and mini mize response times. 
5.3.2 AI/ML Enhancements 
Future enhancements for the platform aim to provide improved Nepali language sup port by training custom language models on larger corpora, developing Nepali-specific named entity recognition, better handling idioms and cultural references, and creating a 
19
Nepali–English parallel corpus to improve translation quality. These efforts will make the system more accurate and context-aware for Nepali content, addressing current lim itations in multilingual processing. 
The platform will also incorporate advanced summarization techniques, including hybrid extractive and abstractive approaches, query-focused summarization to answer specific user questions, and multi-document summarization for related articles. Ad ditional layers for fact-checking and verification will be implemented to ensure the reliability of generated summaries. 
Enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities are planned, expanding beyond simple positive, negative, and neutral classifications to detect multiple emotions such as joy, anger, fear, and sadness, as well as sarcasm and irony. Context-aware sentiment de tection will be applied, particularly for political content. Moreover, misinformation detection will be integrated, featuring fake news detection algorithms, source credibil ity scoring, third-party fact-checking, and claim verification against trusted databases. Finally, content quality assessment will evaluate articles for clarity, bias, political lean ing, clickbait, and adherence to journalistic standards, ensuring that users receive high quality, trustworthy news. 
5.3.3 Business Model Development 
Future development plans include monetization strategies to sustain and expand the platform. A freemium model will offer basic features for free while providing premium capabilities to paying users. Additional revenue streams may include API access for businesses and researchers, white-label solutions for news organizations, and ethical, non-intrusive advertisement integration.
